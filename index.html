<h2> About Me </h2>

 <p>I am an aerospace engineer and game developer based out of Seattle, Washington.  My research interests are experimental rocket propulsion specifically rotating detonation engines,  hypersonic jet propulsion, high-temperature aerodynamics and materials science for propulsion, and aircraft/spacecraft design. In my free time, I like to work on action games and role-playing games with Unreal Engine 5.  </p>
